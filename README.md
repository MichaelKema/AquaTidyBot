Usage
Commands
!start [channel]: Initializes the bot and sends a message to the specified channel (or current channel if not specified). Users can react to this message to get assigned roles.
Role Management
When the bot is initialized with the !start command, it will ask if you want to customize the role names. You can then provide names for the roles associated with each emoji:

ðŸ¥¤: Bottle Check
ðŸ’§: Hydrated
ðŸ§¹: Clean Room
Periodic Reminders
The bot sends periodic reminders to the channel it was initialized in:

update_hydrated_roles: Runs every 2 hours.
update_bottle_check_roles: Runs every 3 hours.
update_clean_room_roles: Runs every Saturday and then every 4 hours on that day.
Example
!start #bot-channel
This command will initialize the bot in the #bot-channel and send a message that users can react to for role assignment.
